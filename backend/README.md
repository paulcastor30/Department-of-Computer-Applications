# Backend README

This folder contains the **Django backend** for the Department of Computer Applications website.

The backend is responsible for:

- content management through Django admin
- public API endpoints for the React frontend
- media and file handling
- editorial roles and permissions
- structured data for accreditation and quality related content

## Current stack

The backend uses Django 6.0.3 together with Django REST framework and `django-cors-headers`.【turn189303view0†L0-L0】【turn837861view2†L0-L2】

The settings currently show domain apps under `apps.core`, `apps.academics`, `apps.people`, `apps.research`, `apps.extension`, `apps.communications`, and `apps.quality`, alongside a temporary `dca_app` compatibility layer during migration work.【turn837861view2†L1-L2】

## Backend structure

A typical backend layout in this project is:

```text
backend/
├── apps/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── academics/
│   ├── people/
│   ├── research/
│   ├── extension/
│   ├── communications/
│   └── quality/
├── dca_site/
├── dca_app/
├── manage.py
└── db.sqlite3
```

## Responsibilities by app

### `apps.core`
Cross cutting content such as site settings, homepage data, department profile, hero sections, and quick stats.

### `apps.academics`
Programs, curriculum related data, educational objectives, student outcomes, and academic FAQs.

### `apps.people`
Faculty and staff directory data, profile content, qualifications, and achievements.

### `apps.research`
Research areas, projects, publications, laboratories, and metrics.

### `apps.extension`
Community extension programs, partnerships, outcomes, and service impact.

### `apps.communications`
News, events, downloadable resources, and public contact related content.

### `apps.quality`
Evidence documents, accreditation ready structures, and quality support metadata.

## Local setup

From the `backend` folder:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

## Useful commands

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py shell
```

If the project includes custom management commands such as role setup, run them after migrations:

```bash
python manage.py setup_roles
```

## API design direction

The backend is moving toward:

- serializers per app
- read only public endpoints for public content
- admin driven content editing
- explicit permissions and editorial roles
- incremental replacement of hardcoded placeholders

Examples of API namespaces expected in this structure:

```text
/api/core/
/api/academics/
/api/people/
/api/communications/
/api/quality/
```

## Admin and editorial workflow

Django admin is the internal editorial interface. The intent is to support roles such as:

- site_admin
- qa_editor
- program_editor
- faculty_editor
- research_editor
- communications_editor

These roles should be permission based, not superuser based.

## Backend contribution ideas

### Good first issues
- improve admin labels and help text
- add `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural`
- add serializer tests
- clean up duplicated logic
- improve docstrings and comments

### Intermediate issues
- add list and detail endpoints for remaining models
- improve queryset filtering and ordering
- add pagination to public endpoints
- add media previews in admin
- strengthen validation for important models

### Advanced issues
- add structured accreditation mapping support
- implement custom publish permissions
- improve search across models
- refactor compatibility code out of `dca_app`
- add CI checks for backend code quality

## Development expectations

- keep models explicit and well named
- add migrations for all model changes
- prefer small, reviewable pull requests
- avoid mixing unrelated schema and API changes
- keep admin usability in mind when designing models

## Notes for contributors

This backend is being built incrementally. Some modules may still be in transition while the repository moves from a thin Django shell to a fuller content and API backend. Contributions that improve structure, readability, and maintainability are valuable.
